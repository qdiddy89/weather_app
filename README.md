# weather_app

I chose the WeatherUndergound api for this project because of the depth of information they make available,
and the fact that it was free.

This app requires the python requests library to work properly.

Database data can be loaded by using the following command on the db.json file:
`python manage.py loaddata db.json`

It does not have way to add new users other than the admin panel (localhost/admin). 

username: admin
password: apaxpass
